i in fact, do not remember bc i was at pgh lol.. 

but today was hella unproductive... alarm went off at 6:20 and i straight up said fuck it im not going to practice ðŸ˜­ cuz i was staying up writing blogs till 2:30 last night idt it was a good idea being up early

as the time we speak its 12:16 and im still writing this blog and i might just skip tmr ngl... if im not here im just sleeping dw

and then just did upsolves all day... by which i mean 3 atcoders, 3 cfs and like 2 nois. didnt do a lot compared to yesterday tbh.. but tmr theres cf and im looking forward to that ngl hopefully i dont get rekt again and maybe ill hop into nfls contest if it exists tmr night??!

i honestly miss talking to ppl now... used to be nice when i can ring someone and knowing someone will be there to pick up but that luxury doesnt exist anymore... unfortunate ig but i have a blog and some ppl who read... the thoughts are rly just captured by the lyrics today.. when now we all know our answers, its hard to ignore the answers and the paths that leads to it. but ya unfortunate

the talk was like joseph aliz vincent and will charlie... four of them be on this list every day lol and thats awesome

monkeying with more stuff tmr should do some experiments

someone pls ping me about blog todos if you see this im so behind ðŸ˜”

im reviving this blog since the craze at school passed. i still wanna send this to alter, ifrm and just ppl i know out of school. school sucks. 

my mindset in cc: i wake up and feel like shit, i go to track, see [redacted] and [redacted] and feel like shit; i see mason and i wanna live again; i see two oter ppl and i feel like shit; i see henry and logan and i wanna live; i see bush and i wanna die; i see the seniors and i wanna live again.

and ya my quotes say it all today... im in a crisis but time to prep amc surely

help

my mental has never been lower... idk neg effect of camp pushing jr yr ig?

woke up at 5:35 cuz idk why i just cant fucking fall asleep after, couldve got another 10 mins but why would i when i can like not do it... decided to start the habit of logging my state of mind in walking time and get some some reflections in... and im increasingly negative by the daily... again, neg effect of camp pushing in jr yr...

the run was ok, did 6.5, first half with preston and second half with colton. the sprint was good, i dont feel too shiity for tmr, just nervous and uhhh stressed... im just in a shitty mood so its kinda annoying.. maybe loggin by the half hour/twice per pd would be a better idea?

multi was chill, quiz was prety chill, 4 of the questions are free, the other question was semi free after i realied the solid was rotated around x axis... skipped nontriv amt of casework after which is very sweet.. did one silly after check so i had to redo some of my issues. shes chill with our test so we turned out to be fine anyways... 

ap euro has been bad and it turned out to be bad again cuz i didnt realize how awful i did on my test..

actually productive today lol

fixed the noi18 stuff and got day 2 setup as well which is nice

got the final problem in the egypt hw set, wrapping up that 25-prob set for good. the last problem is interesting but not worth a seperate article so i will describe it here.

the problem is basically Shamir's secret sharing with n<=4. the idea is you use xor checksum at a point and then always keep a digit for the checksum. the idea is pretty simple but involves a lot of print table and bashing nonsense so i didnt like the impl

tmr is noi24 and keep writing imo sol sketches so will likely have a quad article day (post run ideas, imo skectches, noi24d1, night thoughts)

chill day... still didnt make up blogs lol ðŸ˜œ but we can wait on that... got a 552 in??! 12 hour contest hours in a day is again, insanity i think...

congrats to nfls, they manage to pull problems that even i knew.... if i knew it and i cant do crap with problem volume... its either saying that im getting a lot of problem foundations or nfls is falling off (bit of both lol)

also got a LIT (pun intended) team td... gonna get carried by mr alternet camper himself :orz: yay yay yay. 

talked to bush during practice and it was surprisingly easy.. i need weekdays meets, district and then 2 more so hey i take those!!! yayyyyyy

the first 5 was some random contest i got for joseph and lilliana to "train", kinda messed up myself as well. was like a set no harder than an easy NAC but i got n-3... which is bad.... tbf they also just put kd tree template on there but no template for me...

second 5 was nfls... which turned out to be CC24d2 + CCO24d1t2... are we really gonna do that??! lmao.... nfls doing nfls things...

tmr is like egy set + book. ideally no naps.. maybe 1hr can be good??! im not even sure lol....

egy set is kinda nerve reking, per mr rpeng i can gap egy rk1 5h with 3h which is concerning cuz i think hes overestimating me.

some memes for the usa peeps

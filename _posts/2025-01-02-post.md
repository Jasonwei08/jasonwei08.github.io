today i talked to two sage people (charlie and ezra for anyone curious)

to make sure i rmbr what happened i record my thoughts and some summary here

ezra convo came first

on the current hot (or not so) issue of women in stem

there are three viewpoints here

1. women in stem is abundantly emphasized, thus it should cease to exist

2. women in stem is abundantly emphasized, but it should still exist

3. women in stem is not emphasized enough, the ratio should achieve 50/50 if not more

the argument essentially boils down to the issue where in theory intellectual capacity is uniform independant of gender, which means there should be a 50/50 in all fields of occupation no matter what

thus the idea of meritocracy came into play

what results in the current difference in gender roles?

1. bias, no need to explain on that

2. difference of resources, in which women has traditionally received less resources (reasons why see republican motherhood)

however, there are multiple factors that lead to those two points above

income, race, country of origin etc..

meaning that filling difference in gender is somewhat similar to affirmative action

and affirmative action has been proved to be against meritocracy

meritocracy cannot be done unless in a ideal society in which we all know ideal societies do not exist

like hbcus, women in stem is a valid campaign and the idea behind it is commendable and admirable

then why do women in stem activities spark mass controversy

recall the cancellation of affirmative action

many has "packaged" and "labeled" children into a mold that is suitable for affirmative action when one is not (financial aid instead of racial affirmatives are referred here)

same has happened with women in stem

the idea is quite commmendable but there are too many that take it as a loophole and use it to their advantage

in me and ezras words "love the idea, hate the execution of such ideals"

charlie convo happened second (well ig it did start yesterday with the resolution)

after reading of blog, she suggested me that i am not actually lonely, it is that my behaviors that repel people

which is a very valid point and i am in active thinking to change

but conversations like this happened a lot of times before but i didnt change

what is the difference

i am a much more calm and collected person over text/discord but i am quite lousy at school

find the reason of the difference and i might be able to change it

then i was given my eureka moment

1. i feel lonely when i am alone which allows more self reflection and humility

2. i have superiority complex, which means i feel like i am above school and it is wasting time

3. it is easy for me to be triggered, meaning that in talking, i often fail to listen, think and react

all of which are valid

in which the 1, 3 are easily resolvable, as in shifting a perspective and continue humility to those known at school

shifting foci to the more positive things

2 is hard to overcome for me since school is a waste of time more often than not for me

but i cant grad early or just be homeschooled

might as well have some fun and learn to collab since i dont get that once i get into college

theres enough rigor waiting for me

two convos that opened my worldviews today

thanks ezra thanks charlie!

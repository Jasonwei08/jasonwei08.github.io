today is the day i ran the final track meet of the season

cuz im not going to a pity meet

3200 is honestly mid, i ran faster than last time with some goofy high heart rate, 11:40 at 89 degree weather is what i can take

5:45 5:55 splits is also something i can take

rly goddamn sore after that tho

went to hang out in trainers and grabbed kylie and peter to see whos in school

crazy finds honestly we found ms ellis grading test (2/2 success rate on finding her after 5pm on my end)

and we found ethan yang on solo contest

crazy finds and i was in a pretty good mood

time flew by and i was having fun

had a pretty solid plan came the mile, wanted to split 75 76 75 72 for somewhat close to 5, maybe that 72 wasnt that realistic

but i was eyeing for logan and kyminh

so heres the long story time

lap 1 was a 75, stayed comfy at 7th

surged up on the first 200 of lap 2, got kaleb and kyminh

300 meter into my lap i heard my name being called, thinking it was a cheer i listened closer

"jason SLOW DOWN"

immediately snapped me out of that race

i turned around seeing a full crowd and i got so confused

who was telling me to slow down

maybe its the dickinson kids cuz they got a guy behind me

i was thinking and not paying attention

but i still got to keep the lead for almost a lap

300 into lap 3 i ran down the same spot

i heard the same voice call my name

and i hear the words "slow down"

confounded i turn around just to see kaleb logan kyminh on my tail

while searching for that person who made the voice, i got passed by all 3 of these people

distracted, dumbfolded, stupified, i look ahead, trying to focus again

i ran a 20 second straight on there

i ran a 18 sec split for every 100

last lap was chase in vain, momentum was just gone and nowhere to be found

with my head blanking out, crossed the line at 5:10, 4th with the dust

as i lay down on the ground, muscles twitching, i cried loud

why cant i deliver on the final race of my season

final, last race of my season, with such a great start, i just could not get my delivery and execution

and then i strated recalling the voice on the straight

asking ellie, kylie, and many spectators on the race

they gave me the sound confirmation that lap 2 and lap 3 had only the 4 wranglerwrettes on that spot on that 300

i raged, ran to kaleb, pointed at his girlfriend and started accusations

which now i look was a bad choice on my part

it was not her

he pointed me at a friend directed me there and i walked up to her

"hey did you tell me to slow down"

she shook her head, no

i hate someone who ruins someone elses fun

but i hate a liar more

and i hate a person who lies about ruining someone elses fun

robinson came up to me, told me to calm down

i went to bush

bush told me to just wait and talk to him

i did

so now i have a few questions for the person/people who was yelling at me to slow down

1. do i know your name

2. did i ever talk to you

3. did i ever do soemthing rude to you

4. did you not know that for most of us, this was the final race of the season

5. did you know that you shouldnt be yelling at people to slow down during a fast mile race

6. did you know you costed someones final race in jr yr, said person dont even know you

7. can you be fucking honest

8. can your friends stop trying to cover you up

anyways im in majority over it

i do know their names now

if i see them again i will be making them have a bad time

but ig we live in fwood and ofc its the dance kids who cant let people have fun

cuz their entire personality is pickme and being unable to do a real damn sport

well i hope you never show up to a track meet again

hopefully today was a bad enough experience for you

if you do just make sure you dont get caught by me

3:30 looks incredibly hard atm of speaking

knee feels a lot better which is good

some reading and research done before race and ig bar chart decision tree-y thing

take gel 45 min before start

ideal gel miles: 5, 10, 14, 18, 22, 25

early fatigue gel miles: 4, 8, 12, 17, 21, 24

mile splits (ideally)

mile 1 to 5 7:50 to 8:00

mile 6 to 13 7:45 to 8:00 

mile 13 to 17 7:45 to 7:50

mile 17 to 20 7:50 to 8:00 

mile 20 to 23 7:45 to 8:00 

mile 23 till end just go out

dont go out too quick

ideally hr should be under 160 till around mile 10

hr should DEF be under 163 till around half marathon

under 167 at around mile 20

the rest 10k i dont care just fucking go

if hr doesnt go above 172 just go, red line is around 175

tap out if absolutely necessary, but id rather pass out on the course then to tap out on my own

sigh im dying on this hill

its gonna suck till mile 3 bc the crowd and the early coldness will be annoying

after mile 3 to mile 16 is the golden times, zone out and try to "bank" some time if possible, but dont go under 7:45 at any time before mile 14

mile 16 to 20 is gonna be somehow annoying, make sure you dont get any tap out ideas by then, take extra gels if necessary

mile 20 to 23 is absolutely cruciel, know that support is near and after mile 23 things do get easier. think about the ppl who supported you and think about the ppl who called on your fails

mile 23 to 26.2, let the crowd carry you home, victory lap of the final 3 miles

dont tap out unless you absolutely have to

know that jasonwei from the past and the future would rather you pass out on the course than to walk off the course

ill write another one soon

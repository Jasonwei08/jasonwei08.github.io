so ya just got home from running. took it ez today with a 6 miler, tmr were trialing cant put pressure on them legs too much... got a call from rpeng right after the run about the 295 situation. it was a lot worse than i thought. app rpeng is claiming that hes taking over the icpc entirely at cmu and what happens with team placesments and all that etc. which means that 295 becomes irrelevant in the sense of icpc team selections... and im gonna zoom with danny at like 1pm td so idek what to say and what to do i mean the class was rly rly enjoyable the few semesters that i did/set probs for and i rly wanna continue but i dunno what danny is gonna say... ig we see at 1pm then

the relationship with the cc kids are just going downhill from this point on... half of them wont talk to me. its just kyminh devon will logan mason and the twins... maybe its cuz im weird and obnoxious ig... but thats good i get to calm down and just full push the cow camp things then... cmon dude its the last 8 months get thru it and youll be fine.

anyways its naptime, sleeping at 3 doesnt rly help with my energy during daytime as well. and unfortunately this might be a permachange in the schs now...

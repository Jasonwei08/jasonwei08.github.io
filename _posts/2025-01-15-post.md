title: school, loneliness, and why im "easy"

i am writing this a day late

today ellie told me i am "easy" in terms of relationship

i didnt know what she meant until there was a better explanation

app it meant that im easy to develop feelings

asked the twins about that and they said that it is true, it is just that i dont realize it

uh now i think of it there are a lot of quotes that kinda support

eg someone once said "easy to get him to confess everything to you, just say hi to him in the halls for a week"

and now, me as a confused human think about what i did for a year for social interactions

there is a validity to what that someone said

but i think the def of easy is pretty diff here?

one suggests in terms of relationship the otehr is just me purely seeking out connections

i think this comes down to me being somewhat clingy?

weirdly enough some of my seemingly deepest connections are immediately gone once my info gap was exploited

makes me think why people talk to me, for me or for my things?

as in is it who i am that makes people connect to me, or what i possess

in terms of getting value, i am easy, hard to admit

i dont know who i can even connect with irl now

most likely joel twins aliz and emma? idk sometimes its just hard to diff what people are here for

maybe not even the twins nor emma? idk idk idk

but this is truly a moment

people think im annoying and mean

sometimes im just loud

parker said ellie is rly nice to me

she walked into chem td no greeting "where is charlie"

this is when one knows

well at least logan in that class and we get to yap?

i walk out to physics today seeing logan and ellie 

ellie usually grabs him post chem 

and no greeting no asking about tes "where is charlie"

sigh

day before charlie wasnt here and they didnt show up

twins most of the time dont wait for me

i dont have people to walk with

i dont have people to talk to

yk what i should do tmr

just wait till the end of class and see who waits for me

my guess is 1

time to get big depressed

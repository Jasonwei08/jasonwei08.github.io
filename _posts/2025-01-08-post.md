I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW WHO I AM AHHHHHHHH

that live is such a vibe holy shit i love every second of that thing

more concert vods today

iris hits sooooo hard esp with that rain concert

hozier also hits esp with that voice of his

coldplay and ed are good per usual

today i figured out elegia magic so thats cool

i lowkey stemmed out during stats and some weird ass sophs were sneering at me but its wtv i dont care enough to crash out on them

didnt talk to like more than 2 ppl at school today

lmao i dont think twins are in good mood td

or they lowkey dont wanna talk to me today for some reason

its fine

i am confirmed to have petella tendonitis or however tf you spell it

11 days till marathon im very fucking scared

but icing it was prolly the right call there tbh

was somehow extremely useful to my knees and it was not hurting as much

did another 6 miler after school today and no pain

i think its great that it heals lowkey very quick

and then i listen to iris

speaking of iris

ifrm gave 200iq philosophy lesson today

coming from someone who went thru a relationship himself i think ill trust what he said

he claims that hs relationships are essentially a strong personal connection

maybe people fail to realize that establishing a relationship does not gurantee a strong personal connection and vice versa

maybe people would be more open to a strong personal connection rather than a relationship

they just fail to make the assoc that being involved in a relationship doesnt directly corrolate with strong personal connections

another point being mentioned is that more important things are friends to be unhinged with

as in someone to not pretend who you actually are and be very honest and true to

ofc things like those are not easy to find and theres a lot of ppl who still cant figure how their own minds work

but i think what he said make sense

welp you can also treat this as in some salty cs kids who cant find a relationship coping but its whatever

time to paste some quotes by him that i actually liked a lot

"there were discrepancies between my internal idealistic view of the relationship and reality"

"but i think if u are aware that you are looking for this sort of genuine connection when choosing friends it is easier"

"the realization that i was kind of implicitly looking for a relationship to get back that personal connection"

"because if im trusting them enough to talk real shit with them then i am also trusting them to basically see me without the mask"

marathon is in 11 days

will prolly do like a 15 miler this weekend and rest up my legs

ill be ready

again iris BANGS SO HARD OMG

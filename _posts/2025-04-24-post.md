and no, this region preview is not xc region preview

region academics is in 24 hours and im severely nervous

surreal experience btw

feels like 2024 april is back in my head again, rushing stats, rushing ns, rushing school, and this and that

and boarding a 5am bus and proceeded to throw math and ns

crying my eyes out and be called a brat cuz "4th was a good place"

missing state again for the 2nd time

i dont want it happen for the 3rd time in a row now

i prepped math

i prepped ns and might have skipped a few classes for that

but the more i prep the less i know

first is always the contest nerves. 

reminding myself of last year was always rough, missing first few questions and losing by that few questions was rough

i want to make sure it doesnt happen again but who knows

its not like i perfectly avoided that every contest

math too

i fret the stupid things i cant see when i read the problems

but its not like i dont do that every single mock i do

contest nerves, and i cnat do anything about that

maybe get a good nights sleep ig

and second is just

idk what the other 3 guys are doing now

team seems to lose hope and i lose hope

idk why but no tests

idk this is getting annoying

and its in 1 day

hopefully the run makes me feel better ig

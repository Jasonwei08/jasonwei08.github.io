one of bushs favorite thing to say is "what does mustang thunder mean to you"

today i put some deep fucking thought into it and heres what mustang thunder mean to me

absolutely nothing

you know, its been 3 years ive been on this miserable team

lets account for what i got

freshman year

great year to start off, bush ran one of the hardest workout ive done to this day, on the first day of me to practice

fucked up my hamstring and disabled me from runnig for two weeks, missed the base training

ran xc season with some of the most awful form that i can have and somehow didnt get corrected

wanted to run mile, but ended up going 32, idk he said its developing my charcter

never ended up under 7 in the mile, he stopped me when i ran 7:01, 32 was absolutely embarassing

let about 20 to 30 racist temu jokes fly cuz i didnt care

sophomore year

overworked and peaked way too early due to some interval schedule he put out during xc season

had to get my mentor, my parents, myself, to send him, three seperate emails, to excuse me from a meet that he forgot to enter me in

he proceeded to ignore me for the rest of xc seasons, pretended to not see me during workouts

went under 20 in 5k but in his books my pr was still 21:20 after district

got yelled at for running on my own when he assigned us work because i ran 7 instead of 3 miles

overbooked again during track and had tragic it band injury mid season

the under 5:30 never happened in a meet

i quote this "you should go out on lane 2 to give you kicker teammate a chance" im not a fucking saint thank you

after i said no to that i never got a mile race (there were spots, 3 meets)

got snubbed from district to get a sr who shows up half of the time, tops, that doesnt run my event, so he "can enjoy his senior year"

jr yr

finally got my own rhythm of running, started 50 mile weeks in china

got yelled at cuz he thinks i peaked during summer

ran 19:20 during xc season after injury mid season (im seeing a pattern here)

11th place district and got medal taken bc i didnt top 10

our fav srs chase and matt got snubbed to state for jack nolan and sam, 3 freshmen

mind you those are the spots that dont matter they dont run alterates

signed up for marathon during off season and got yelled at cuz "interferes with track"

as if he ran me in any good meets

got clowned on after passing out at mile 20 at houston

got yelled at after finishing woodlands, "your track season is ruined"

proceeded to sub 5 in the mile

got snubbed from district again bc he moved down 2 ppl from varsity to jv

our fav sr matt didnt get a spot

and now we have to go to a intrasquad that doesnt matter

pity meet

he doesnt listen to shit

we keep getting ignored during workouts

he shows up to practice later than we do

so what does mustang thunder mean to me

i have an answer now

it means that no matter how bad my coach is, how irresponsible he is, how unknowledgable, stubborn he is, always listen to him

it means that no matter what his motive is, protect his small ego cuz thats all he has

it means that if he wants to brag about the 3 people that he didnt effective train and worked on their own, let him have it

it means when hes talking to the girls excessively when hes engaged, let him do it

mustang thunder delayed my running for 2 years, ruined my passion for cross country

but who am i to doubt about these things i cant even have a spot on a jv track meet

the wind was in my face this morning

i dont like running as much i think i do

but the only thing that drives me is that race in 13 days

i am ready

hopefully

the nap wasnt good today

i could barely fall asleep for no reason whatsoever

now life sucks

i think im just lonely

maybe im stuck in this until i change

i need to change

teamscode meeting happened

got a lot of good problems done

felt stupid cuz i solve too slowly

paranoia wont stop now

i always think ppl dont wanna talk to me

they most likely dont

why am i such a loser

i always hope for tranqulity at school

and yet when i get it i hope for less of it

i feel empty

maybe i need to find a soul

maybe i lost my soul on the way

maybe i need to find emotions

but do something about it

god awful... 

actual awfulness holy moly... 

sat was sat (pun pun pun)... woke up at 4:50, stuck in bed for a bit and then decided to go do my long run cuz i like dopamine rushing during my sats... got like a very solid 10 miler in, on the westwood/west ranch/falcon ridge/avalon/west ranch loop today, felt good during the morning cuz the weather is fucking awful like 7:30 weather... 

and i did get that domapine rush after the run, 2 shots of espresso after that as well, i felt like a real fucking human again, got some remedial advice from mr potato himself and i went into the test room.

reading 1 was like not even hard? i think i miss 2 tops? i think... surely i dont miss like 5 right? and then reading 2 was god awful, i think i miss like 5 to 7... total up to a good 7 to 9, ending up with another 700 to 750.. just gonna bang on my luck to bail me out this time?? math was just uneventful, had a cancer analytic geo and a cancer alg but sat math is not hard for me if you know me lmao

and then went home drained asf, tried to do some cp and i could not think at all... coffee side effects kicking in during that time is the singular worst feeling. took a nap till 12:45 and woke up trying to ucup, and lemme guess, that did not work... we got 1 prob and i went back to sleep... woke up at like 4pm and did some bookwork and had class for a bit... 

sat was so awful (pun intended again lmfao)

sunday was ok, woke up at 6:40 for atcoder, got like 2 probs during arc so we take those small victories... cf got spoiled cuz of class and i took nap after class again lmfao... im in short of naps...

went to bookwork, not a lot of things going on... tested borts round but i cant write shit here cuz that would be cheating

another class from 6 to 9 and then went out on a 3 miler after

kinda just idled in discord cuz i dont wanna do shit...

11:13 pm and im in a decnet mood cuz i packed, goodnight houston!

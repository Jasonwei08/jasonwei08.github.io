locked in for the marathon as in reg complete

10 days left and some taper things to do

1. do some strength stuff

2. dont risk workouts

3. start carbing next week

4. establish race strat

do not overbook, do not overbook

first 10k, pace off 7:50 to 8:00, stablity and ideally follow off pacer if theyre not too off

second 10k pace off 7:45 to 7:55, ideally the slower end, worst case just go off pacer

third 10k pace off 7:45 to 8:00, if caught up by pacing just hang with them

30-35k just hang with someone, hang with someone and dont fall off

35-40 will prolly be the hardest 5k in my life, eat gel if necessary

last 2k just let the crowd take you home

take gel at mile 5, mile 10, mile 14, mile 18, mile 21, mile 24 (if necessary and able to take in food

take gel at 6:50, 10 min before start

some quotes that i felt good about

when the glycogen runs out, let the heart take over

sometimes just hang off someone is the best choice

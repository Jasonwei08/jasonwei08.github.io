first jv meet today

ran 32 and 16...

was hoping that meet gets canceled but at 1 santa fe was claimed to be "bright and clear"

it was not in fact, bright or clear

rain started going wild midway into freshman 32

also sante fe coaches did not inform us that the kids will actually not go together thus 20 min of warmup wasted good one guys

mass just adds 3 lbs bc my uniform was soaked and that race start was very fucking unpleasant

thru 800 at around 2:45, thought timing was perf but i forgot i went out at 71

mile at 5:35, which isnt bad per say? going quite conservative at the start which kinda fucked me up in the end

lap 5, 6 marks the biggest moves that i can physically do, passed 4 on lap 5 and passed kd on lap 6

caught up to henry and this guy dont wanna lose so he just went ahead of me which is bad

caught up to another angleton dude at lap 7, places me at 4th behind logan kyminh and henry

uhhhh i dont wanna talk about lap 8 (tldr i got passed at the line by the sprint and ended up 5th)

coping mech was saying that i get him in the mile

11:19 so we take these ig

2 mile cooldown was somewhat good, realized that i have ~0 time to spare after cooldown cuz no hurdles

1 mile warmup and felt tight at the line

realized that im not going anything conservative on the mile so got a 71 at lap 1

halfway at 2:28 by then i thought i have a chance at sub 5

ironically i was 8th at the point where i crossed halfway...

i got literally every single one of them at lap 3 what

kd and henry got caught on lap 3 and i enter lap 4 with logan and only logan in sight

by then i was at 3:47 and i realized im not going sub 5 today

last lap was hard cuz ik that angleton dude was behind me (spoiler alert, he wasnt and the cloest dude was half a curve behind

came in dead sprinting and was ~8 secs off logan

5:10 ig we also take this on a wet track + 32 ahead

logan didnt run sub 5 iirc

fwood swept t4

fwood couldve swept if i didnt fuck up 32

next time prolly suffer a bit more

but it was fun

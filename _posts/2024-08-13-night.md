yk what imma be positive for once td... despite this day being one of the worse days recently...

did 600s reps (6) this morning, avged 2:06 so its not a bad way to start this thing off

and then school just gonna suck... stats seem fun, euro seems fun... its pretty much over after that

ig i have evan and ethan in 2 of my classes but thats not that good since we also have [redacted] (clarification that redact isnt charlie)

but ya its gonna be a tough yr... yk maybe start reading more and print some stuff out... its fine...

but the night flew by with bookwork and stuff.. book work was fire and i like actually did productive shit td so its all good

then tmm contest had me subbed in last min so kinda wild... and i won??!!! also kinda wild... yk imma take this as in my cinderella story to camp push lmao

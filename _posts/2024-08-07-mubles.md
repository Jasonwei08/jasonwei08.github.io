take me out and take me home!!!! lonely sometimes.... taylor swift has like good quotes as well.... man. every time i hear that song i just have tears rolling down my face wth man... just takes me back to like last few months in china and the first few months on usa and im just transitioning between the happy dude i was to just ultimate loneliness... it was the one of the worst times of my life and i dont wanna live it again but seems like im reliving it again... who else can i blame thats not me tho

did a bit of stuff td... had 3h meetings with [redacted] and talked about actual business and now i feel pretty shit about myself... is it worth it to do all this.. and what if i dont make camp... what if i just dont make it... is it just all over sigh... 

also made [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xzk9ibAvV_iq3Sb-Hp6ztWrUB2c-eYwuaHPKJoaFV0g/edit?usp=sharing) to record my progress in algo guide. updating some book work tmr...

still did not catch up with blogs cuz meeting happened. 10 to 1 meeting kinda op... 

egy set was not bad, 100/100/8 with 4h is not bad... i think i will upsolve and catch up with blog tmr.... im not even sure if ill have time... but wtv... 4h should be more than enough.... if not make it day afters work. i think i actually will prolly gap next for a bit

running was actually not bad. got like a good sub hour 8 miler attempt going, and it worked like magic.. questionable team placements and everything but who cares im not racing lol... 

im again on the verge of maybe burnouts, charlie is actually right again... how tf is she always right... lets hope mid soph yr stuff not happen again cuz i would absolutely hate it if i start having headaches and emotional breakdowns during class... that was a bad time... ig thats why i like that song sm, just gives me the vibes of comfiness that i dont ever get... maybe i need to find someone that can share burdens and joys... molly isnt here ðŸ˜­ and i miss her more than ever

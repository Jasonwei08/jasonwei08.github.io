i have been in the weird state of production and burnout at the same time

i get productive for 4-5 hours post school and i fail to do anything afterwards

i am productive for 4 periods and fail after 

time to rethink my motivations

all this time ive been working to an oasis from afar, with everything that i needed supposedly, its a stairway to heaven

i got to know people who made it to the oasis

its not an oasis but merely a stopping point

the trek in the desert goes on after it

it just will never end and i dont ever see the end

many oasises i passed along the way are the "oasis from afar" for many and they seemed like a mere stopping point

oasis from afar, what up close?

my stress gets ramped up with it getting closer than 14th

maybe i care more than i think?

maybe evan is right im falling i just never know?

well follow my heart if it makes me do something stupid maybe ill just do it then

or maybe i just hate seeing people happy

but idk that pulled a nerve for some reason

ill talk to someone about it sometime

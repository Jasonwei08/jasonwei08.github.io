a look back on the pastimes

the rivers flows on and on

cant stop 

wont stop

take a swim or walk along the shore

and embrace the waters

sometimes i wonder what if i never started coding

sometimes i wonder what if i never did math

had convo with ifrm about things

brought up a good point that butterfly effect is very huge, and like im starting to think what if i was never this annoying shit that i am now

what if i actually never flew to usa 

prolly be going insane in nfls ig but at least get a soulmate

what if i actually never ran

would not find joy or just find joy in sth esle but its a good passion

what if i actually never did math or prog

idk thats the biggest what if by far, think i will end up being a gpa guy and maybe not the annoying shit that i am, and maybe ill be likable for once in my life and ig i wont be a nerd who talks to ppl across the nation and the globe

what if i didnt go to fwood

i lose on several friends but who knows whats going on at some other school at least there prolly wont be delusion comments at lunch table ig

so many what ifs

but no matter how many regrets i have life goes on

cant be living onto the regrets

there are goods and bads but i liked the ppl i get to know along the way ig

there are so many decisions that i wish i never did

shouldnt have wasted grade 5 doing nonsense 

shouldnt have wasted grade 7 being stupid

shouldnt have wasted freshman yr for fresh looking things

shouldnt have made that comment in soph yr

shouldnt have held on that long after summer visit

but so what

there is always time to be better

to change and make up the for decisions that didnt make sense

maybe open up

maybe open up post usaco and dont be a little shit

maybe make up for lost relations and the lost issues

maybe make new friends and cherish the existing ones

maybe go deeper onto prog

life doesnt go our way

and thats ok

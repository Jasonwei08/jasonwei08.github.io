book angle was lit... 6 hrs of impling code and its kinda working out for me... still didnt catch up to bloggings stuff.. i think that needs to be made a seperate time slot... 10 articles and like 1h for each? i think making up one a day plus doing original ones should work... i think... but need to make some times for it

still kinda lonely... but thats ok we getting used to it

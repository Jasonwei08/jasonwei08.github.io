today is the 31st of december of 2024, i am writing this entry with an annoying cough and a somewhat lonely mind

just recording some of my thoughts before the clock brings us to 2025

this is the end of the beginning, 2024 marked the end of many things that i started and changed

end of enjoying cc, never have i despised someone as much as i did. it was a good time while it lasted, ill still enjoy running but, the fun at school is over

end of many, many friendships, for those that i offend, im sorry, for those i didnt offend, im also sorry... 

end of no onsite hangouts, been having a lot lot of fun with the twins

end of point of contact back in china, i do wish her the best of luck with further studies

end of not being an underclassman, but with that, the pressure began

end of being as gullible as i were

end of not reading books

end of french

end of amc10s

end of usaco gold

most importantly, end of a year well lived

this the beginning of the end, 2025 is the hardest year so far and will i be ready

beginning of marathon training blocks

beginning of racing halfs

beginning of more and more rigor and more algo

beginning of more math

beginning of the last chance to achieve what i rly want

beginning of making some new friends

beginning of so many new things that i cant even imagine

beginning of the year to be lived well

sometimes i feel alone

sometimes i feel like i can disappear and no one would care

sometimes its hard to talk

sometimes its hard to say what i think

thats gonna go into another year

fireworks are outside, its bright and cool

im inside coughing and sick

but ill eventually get over it and become a better me

and no matter how grand the show is, it has to be over some day

so watch some fireworks while we can

and live with some fun sometimes

anyways for me

i hope to keep the passion, keep the wit

rid of the rushiness and temper

to the year past and year coming

thanks 2024, hello 2025!

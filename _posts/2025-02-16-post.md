its a long story or not

cross country has this team bonding thing where they buy gifts for each other on their birthday

they always make me cover some money

i always cover some money thinking that its gonna come back at my late bday

did not happen last year

i thought hey maybe it will work out this year and its not like i dont care about them

im also not in need of money so its gonna be alright

today they texted me about kyminhs bday and i prolly am going to cover

it makes me recall the past times with those gifts

yk austin and ainsley didnt invite me to their bday party

they prolly still think im not aware but i am

but its ok i wrote a card

i covered logan

i write mckinley a card when they wanted me to

theres prolly another 2-3 in between that i didnt keep track of

now its another one

yk i prolly missed 2 other parties that i wasnt even aware of or im being delusional again

dont get me wrong i love all of my xc friends (which is majority of that group)

but yk it doesnt feel good when stuff like this happens

maybe i should buy my own but whats that compared to that group of hearts

ill keep faith in them till may who knows maybe im just overthinking this by a lot

innocent until proven guilty and its not like i dont like them

but ik 80% ill be disappointed by may

well if some ppl see this theyre gonna call me a pickme and selfish

maybe i am selfish and maybe im just overthinking

but prove me wrong pls

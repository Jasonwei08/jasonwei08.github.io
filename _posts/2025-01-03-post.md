woke up and run

napped for another hour and then vc

those were things arent worth mentioning for they have no joy

spend the afternoon on the keys and with concerts

tried playing the greatest showman medley but that didnt work out as i thought they would

they did sound good regardless

two hours listening to coldplay

just a puppet on a lonely string

oh who would ever wanna be king

but in a sky full of stars

i think i saw you

what am i even writing

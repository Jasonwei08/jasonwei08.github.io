will add onto this whenever i feel necessary

thinking of mistakes at houston and see if i make them up at woodlands

atm i dont have registration but i do think waiting list will not fail me

1. do not get sick during taper, cough syrup, meds, nyquil WILL AND IS GOING TO CAUSE muscle failure on the day of

2. make sure carb loading is done correctly, last time i also most likely experienced glycogen depletion

3. do not go out faster than intended, for me that is do not dip under 7:50 until mile 20, banking time is NOT an option

4. next training cycle do get to 3h or mile 24, whichever later. 40k might be the better tester than 20 mile

5. fuel proper during the race, do not skip gels, do not skip water stations

6. have faith in training, if you can knock out 20 with faster pace, 26 at 15 secs slwoer per mile wont be a problem

7. on the line, do not get scared to waste clothes, be WARM!

8. EVEN SPLITS EVEN SPLITS

9. thru halfway need to be comfortable, dont think about pushing it even remotely

10. strength training for the last 2 weeks

11. dont go into lactic the day prior

12. workouts can be skipped if necessary

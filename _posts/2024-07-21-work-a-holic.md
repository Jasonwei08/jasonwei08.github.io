work day since waking up (9am)

first of all tried [this problem](https://qoj.ac/problem/503), this was kinda a derpy problem ngl, the general case is actually simple cuz you can just keep a xor checksum and call it quits. however, the smaller cases is what the worst cases come out. but in the end you can still just keep checksum and keep something like a huffman code. egy hw is like 4 problems to go, all of them are pretty much spam segtree im pretty sure ðŸ¤¡. i need to like type up more chinese ds, getting too rusty

and then drove out to houston to meet up w/ parents friend, fixed a light and painted walls. kinda hated it cuz holy shit it was rly rly freaking hot

yard work for the next 3-4 hours, but got one side of the fence done.

translating noi stuff and doing egy oly hw for a long time after and hopefully making some meaningful progress

also [redacted] said "i dunno depends on how much i hang out w my girlfriend" when i asked for a ride, made me kinda salty ngl. loneliness be kicking in sm.

messing w the cs club thingy again tn and got meaningful shit done today. i rly want a new cs teacher....

but ya i think i might have sth to work in at school next yr

speaking of school

having at least one class (most likely 2 to 3) with [redacted] and the twins, kinda hate it but also kinda looking forward to it ngl. school is gonna be a long long ride this yr. i wanna have sicuro but i also dont wanna deal with the issue of "oh jason what did you do to my daughter" cuz her daughter is ehhhh.

practice tmr at [redacted] and that is why im not getting a ride from the [redacted]s, girlfriend this girlfriend that ughhhhhh. but i wanna get a like solid 6 miler in with [redacted].

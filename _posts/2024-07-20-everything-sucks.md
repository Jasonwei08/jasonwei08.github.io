everything sucks today

thus im opening this blog as a public journal just to ramble

thanks to [iframe](https://vmhl87.github.io/starship/) for the idea and inspo

missed atcoder for today, unfortunately that caused some issues cuz of running and coverups. need to do more communications and more contests fs. also are we rly gonna do this "reposition on the line" bs, just a 2 mile race not that deep. ya move your ppl to the front and they still get passed i dont even get the point

ran like 13:12 for 2 miles, absolute dog shit perf but not the worst. maybe should spike up next week

atcoder vp was actually not the worst, G is doable but not in the time limit allowed

ranted to [redacted], [redacted], and [redacted]. got two replies and i think one of them is just ghosting me. who cares

messing around with the cs club thingy at night. why cant ppl just follow crockers and just say what they want. college apps is important i get it dont have to hide all that

also new cs teacher when??! actually -200 iq atm

tmr got to be a better day

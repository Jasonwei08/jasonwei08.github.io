i am indeed writing this in a time of work

aka im writing in school and its busy asf since ap weeks start in 5 days

my bday is also in 5 days

the days when i made jokes about how nobody is gonna rmbr my bday feel so close

the days when i wrote about if xc is ognna get my gift also feel so close

yet its so far

camp emails were out

and i missed camp for the second time in hs

and im gonna try to holstein sr yr ig

ap exams are close

and im yet to undercooked for all of them

as i am thinking might as well write sch down to know the ordering ig

monday: euro

tuesday: chem

wed: study

thurs: stats

fri: apush

mon: off

tues: app2

wed: english + mech

thurs: em

friday: state prep

uil state is two days after ap exams so it will be a lil bit stressed

paranoia hit pretty hard the past week

it is the birthday paradox for me now

the closer it gets the worse it feels

gonna feel pretty damn bad on the day of bday

unless somone surprises me this yr

never had it happen

just get me thru the next 20 days and ill be set for summer

summer isnt gonna be a good time

but at least its sth

im going to physics so ill wrap up by the end of the day ig?

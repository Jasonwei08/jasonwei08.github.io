done for u rohan ‚ù§Ô∏è

new things happenings today (none of them are good)... woke up at 3:30 cuz i could not fall asleep... felt like a piece of dogshit after i woke up but also cant fall back to sleep... thus went to do some bookwork instead...  left house at 6:05 for practice feeling like an absolute dumpster fire... migraine started

brief pause on the migraine during warmups and workout.. fyi im injured again cuz of weights... unfortunately my quads were not having it and i had to quit after mile 3.5... will try to get a decently long run tmr and long run sat hopefully... but if not ill just ggs bye bye... i dont wanna just lose it now... midseason injury sucks... all ive done is like gone with the wind if i go down now... maybe ill push thru and see if my leg break ig... idk

and then went to trainers with devon and yapped a bit ig? late to first period again.. neither ms yee or me cares about it so i aint saying nothing... tmr partial fracs are due but im fine with it atm so prolly will just grab palms stuff... idk not a lot fucks i give about that class tbh.. the migraine counter was around 37 mins... and i got first shot of espresso

ap euro was like nothing tbh... watched a 45 min documentary cuz monahan was not here... obv put it on like *2 speed cuz in what world would i be this -200iq to not do that... finished thru the migraine and tried to sleep but decided to talk to ainsley/adeline instead.. played a bit of tetris with hisham and realized im not that rusty even tho i didnt touch that game during summer.. migraine counter was 30 mins tops

apush was productive jk it wasnt.. i kinda ranted at lauryn cuz she wants to put sped music on slides... i didnt care cuz my work was done ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. played tetris for a bit cuz cfing just hurts my brain too much.. uhhh i beat adeline with her starting 1 min ahead of me ig? idk that was kinda funny... hopefully we dont present tmr.. if we do i cant care enough my work is done... if they fuck up they fuck up. migraine counter was around 25 min

stats frq... timed myself for shits and giggles.. finished at 5 min 12 secs with a full page of answers.. very triv test, 10/10 rec to pull 3 all nighters to study for stats the year prior lol... and then did the mcq review, kinda triv as well. got everything done bef the end of class and then just kinda chilled and bookworked a bit... migraine counter was 42 mins for some reason, didnt even do that much for stuff in that class. 2 shots of espresso during class as well.

physics was ok, did tipers with ethan. tipers were trvial imo. just need to write long enough justifications for mcgowan to give me credit... also wrote a long ass proof to make sure we present it in 7 mins and nobody else can get their shit in lmao, "took one for the class" as them say... heads was still hurting the majority of time (40 mins), another shot of espresso

lunch was chill, well not rly.. charlie kinda yelled at me cuz "i should be moving to the boys side of the table". uhhhh my fault ig? was not made aware that we have boys and girls side of the cc table now. prolly was but i was either too energetic or sleepy to actually pay attention to it ig... read some book after lunch and found how fenwick tree worked out... never actually read the formal proof bef and i found it very cool. tried to explain it to charlie but sadly she thinks im just showing off.. no but fenwick proof is so cool tho. you get like 2d or rurq ideas during the proof. ig nobody wanna listen to my eureka moments. another shot of caffeine down and i feel worse than ever

chem was chill. the stoich probs were lowk not hard but parker got upset cuz 1. i was doing acid problem (tbf she did tell us not to do it after i finished but she got upset when i checked answers). 2. me writing blog? idk thats kinda unreasonable but its ok. she has her ideas and i respect it. did stoich with balin and thought id get carried. i lowk carried lmao... fun lil problems and make ppl know who did the hw and who didnt... not very worried bout quiz tmr cuz yk why would i. hurt head the entirety of class (partially cuz of the trident of adeline evia and brynli). another shot of espresso.

english was designated nap period except i didnt nap today cuz we were doing some research and i was making up my hw... brownfield didnt care tbh... he was just joking around, what a guy... only 15 min of headache and no more shots of espresso

went home and realized parents went downtown and didnt tell me... tis k ill just do bookwork. bookwork for 1.5h after getting some food, and then had a 2h class. did some cnoip mock contest and did alright? i was trolling by going down p4 p3 p2 p1 and setting myself 2h timer on a 4h contest but in the end got 0/0/100/100 so i think i ak in 3.5h??! just simple fun by a simple dude lmao

and then did some amc preps and realized its 10:35pm. thought abt some of mental state and reached the following conclusion

i am in a state of mental instability atm... very unstable... like there can be the smallest shit going on and my mood gets fucked up very easily.. and when i have nobody to text to rant abt its pretty annoying cuz i text like 2 ppl to rant. one of them cut this mf off and then other one is just ghosting me... that sucks... which messes up my mood a lot. going thru a lot of mood swings thats prolly cuz of the amt of coffee ive been drinking in the past 2/3 days its diabolical... and then i also get upset randomly during probs, i think its a burnout sign but who am i to talk lol and who can i even talk to about this lol... checked my discord time avg tds and it was like 47 mins or sth... is on discord for too long maybe? td i got around 20 only... around half of them were actual things i need to be doing... thats a good balance... 

migraine for the entire night, and another 2 shots of espresso to get me thru it... i need to fix my sleep sch after sat (pun intended did you get that lmfao)... also find myself talking to myself a lot more than usual, i alr talk to myself enough and now im doing this... just swing into rhythm and get ur shit tgt lol.. let us hope that my workload gets less by day... but i need to stay productive.. and need to talk to someone ig? idk ill wait for that one person who i think is ghosting me now

10:50 pm and i have not packed for cc tmr yet. gonna try to not get past midnight but i have no gurantees i might update this again if i feel like it... night houston

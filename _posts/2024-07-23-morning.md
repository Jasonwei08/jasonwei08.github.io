woke up in a mood cuz i fucked up noi18 dmoj setup and will spend like 2 hours to fix it. also gonna get day2 set up which will take another 2 hours...

running w/ mason kinda fun lol

workout was 5 miler progression paced 8:03, 7:51, 7:30, 7:12, 6:45 which aint bad per say. got 4/6 of the ppl i wanted to get last night. at this point, seems like that spot 10 is gonna be a dog fight if nobody injures.

well unless bush decided to put a pity alternate like how [redacted] got there last year and we all just lose lol. i mean i actually can see a world where he does it, just gonna hope its not mine.

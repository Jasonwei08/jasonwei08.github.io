i said id rather die on that fucking course than to tap out

i am a man of my words

ya but i did pass out at mile 20 and tehy didnt let me finish which is sad

lessons learned

- dont go out with a singlet and shorts at 30 degree weather

- warm up thoroughly or you get cramps easily

- train up to 24 miles so that the last 2 miles is the only uncertainties

i will keep training until march 1st, where the woodlands half/full will be held

will sign up for half at current point of speaking, if i am able to knock out a 23+ miler i will be doing a full

but the legs need a day or two of break 

will come back soon

feb lockin will be pretty crazy

as i am writing this, it is less than 12 hours to my birthday

here are several things that i bet on under

4.5 people to rmbr without reading this blog

0.5 gifts from xc collectively

theres a lot of lore on that gift thing but thats for another time

i still rmbr a bit of my last birthday

and i rmbr crying twice

i rmbr crying on my birthday as if it was a cannon event

but that was me in the teens

me when i still was a stupid little child

me when i didnt know what was good and what was bad

me when i still gave my heart out to whoever said hi to me

but what was me last yr

it is hopefully in 12 hours that i wlil no longer be that way

it is hopefully in 12 hours that both my bets will hit

or not hit

it is hopefully

and now it is 8 mins till im 17

anticlimatic ending but im sleeping

night yall

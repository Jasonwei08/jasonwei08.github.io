for i have seen the ending, and there is no ascending

rise

rmbr how i said im gonna leave later and see who waits for me last time?

nobody does... nobody does

and i was stupid enough to run that thing 3 times...

math: no twins no owen no hisham

euro: uh chase got dragged out by ainsley

apush: jude adeline joel just leaves ig

stats: dont even get me started on ellie walking here to find me and start asking where charlie is

physics: logan you are gonna break my little heart

chem: joel did not wait

english: he didnt wait and logan walked with kennedy away...

uh cried myself sleep the first time i ran the exp and tried to see if im the only one with nobody

counted charlie, counted ellie, counted joel, counted owen

i am

i got so tilted bc of this btw... i am now borderline thinking theres one person who keep stealing my friends or maybe i have persecutory disorder

cuz i swear after that visit twins didnt wanna talk to me

sigh ill call them sunday and try my luck on them picking up

snow days happened too

was rly cute and did runs around the snow

nothing fun tho reminded me of the last snow at china

last snow at china i had molly

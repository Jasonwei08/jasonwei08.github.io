triple contest td... got rekt on 2 of them and kinda popped off on the third one which is nice! cf was just awful, couldnt solve C and got fst on A, ughhhhh and i dropped to cyan. need to get it back tmr fs... mannnnnn

tmr gotta be better cuz two contest and i wont fuck up

atcoder was also uhhh not good... tunneled vision E and didnt read F. F was not undoable so i shouldve read and wept lol... E tunnel vision is an issue with impl and we need to fix that

ucup was not bad tho lol.. we beat sam anango and boomy with me and bort which is kinda pog. we were 2 ppl, 2 solves, at 2 hours lmao and we solved 3 in hour 3 and 2 on hour 4, one in hour 5. insane comeback pulled off.. it was actually crazy.

blog title decipher: one blog article made up, 3 more to make up lol.. this sucks..

i didnt run today wth... but i need to like make my mileage up tbh... i wanna hit at least 42 this week, ideally 45 by the end of tmr... if i can get up at 5. if not ill go at night...

today i learned that i am most likely (by that 90% or more chance) of running district

cuz bush is gonna move one if not 2 ppl down to jv

no more 3200 for me or mile

now i have decided to meme my next race (which is prolly also my final) by wearing chipmunk ears on race day

bush can get on my ass however he wants i aint taking these off

its gonna be funny asf but ya i think its time to start enjoying life and prep for being a jv sr

cuz what the fuck can i even do at this point with this shitty ass program

i am writing this while listening to mcr so i will use their lyrics to end it ig

give a cheer for all the broken listen here cuz its who we are

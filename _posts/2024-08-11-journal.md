so its not bad at all. i think some work is paying off? sorta ig... more book work incoming.. book isnt going as fast as i heop it would and hopefully i make it up during school... idk its not good.

school starts in 2 days... i dont wanna go.. gonna waste so much time in doing absolutely nothing wtf...

ughhhhh

the sch is simple, wake up at 7, do contest, do contest until 12, sleep for 3 hrs and then bookwork/upsolves till night

im completely closing myself out other than 2/3 ppl, i mean as if ppl wanna talk to me anyways... aliz joseph and charlie is like the ppl i talk to atp.. charlie just asks me for math halp 80% of the time its like 2.2 ppl i talk to.... shutting off feels like crap but ig gotta do what i gotta do

still wasting too much time fs... discord is taking a lot of time... idk prolly shouldnt idle in bkpts server as often lol... 

gotta make more progress on the book... cp is boring you cant do jack shit about it... the earlier you get used to being alone when doing problems the earlier you can succeed.

blog queue and upsolve queue is piling... tmr need to get 2 cfs and 1 ucup in at least... last full day of work lol

6:20 practice is insane wtf are you doing with your life bruh... 

also got a decent 7 miler in td, unfortunately im having small foot pain but hopefully i adjust my shoes tmr and it goes away ig.

45 mile week last week!!! isnt that incredible im hitting 45. last yr this time i was like 25 lol

kinda felt the burnout coming thru... not good at all... i think you just bash the burnout and not care.. i mean its like 3 months no whats the worst thing that can happen.. just get thru march and if you make camp this is all worth it... this is all worth it...

its so fucking lonely here... it is so fucking lonely...

yk what this reminds me of... grade 6 push nfls phase where i was up at 7 and sleeping at 12 with no naps... and i was either in class or on the way to class. that used to at least feel good cuz someone is with me... this time nobody is with me... not even her... shes not here

just treat this at grade 6 whaleland life... maybe its time to talk about dropping running... idk... its just upgraded grade 6 whaleland schemes if you make it thru grade 6 with a girl you can make it thru grade 10 without one surely

but ya if it doesnt turn out good maybe its time to drop cc it was a fun time while im doing it

1:21 am, night houston!

i didnt wake up good today but its gcm inva day so here we go

didnt expect shit to happen tbh since i came into that unprepped and knowing that i did my last test in oct 2024 i think i was gonna lose to all the gcm kiddos

checked in 7:30 and saw yoru and laksh they lowk are some of my fav class of 26 kids now

8:15 ns started and ofc we cant even start on time for the first event

ns felt shit lowkey and i thought i was fs not medealling

and then i somehow medalled

idek what i was doing between verification and test prolly just fucking around with laksh and them

laksh went to sci at 11 i went to run

4 mile tempo cuz i dont feel like long running and walking back sweaty and cant shower

and then i think riley and nadia showed up?? gcm lowkey has no org out of stem events

went out to eat with allen nadia and laksh to popeyes. didnt get food cuz trying to not get a lot of deep fried shit for houston preps

locked in briefly for math studies and we started math at 2:30 

and then i somehow got 212 lmfao

38-2 splits and i shouldve got my calc and stats questions right sigh

messed around with the gcm kids for a while and then i head back

took some pics and put it on story

was rly fun

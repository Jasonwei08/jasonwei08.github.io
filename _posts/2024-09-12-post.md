i have nothing else to say other than this morning... the rest of the day flew past and i cant take my mind off of what happened.

two days ago was the day someone announced that "we have open spots and were hosting a time trial" and that gave me immense amt of hope? why? cuz i ran my ass off this yr and i didnt get a singular good race this yr and i wanted a spot, even temporary. and i have faith in my training, i have more fitness than my competitiors and i just couldnt execute my race.

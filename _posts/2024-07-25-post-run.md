so did yassos today cuz i didnt wake up for practice

dont blame me i slept at like 3:20 last night so uhhhh i didnt wanna go do some goofy ahh speed workout at 7 in the morning with 3 and a half hours of sleep tyvm.

ya anyways went out for yassos later today and dude it was the best workout of my life.

some sort of brief introduction of the yasso:

- 800 fast, 400 recov times 10, no restrictions on the recov time

- the 800 avg time is supposed to predict your marathon time and 8k time


so i thought why not try it right

holy crap best run of my life

avgs were 3:14, 3:12, 3:11, 3:10, 3:11, 3:09, 3:07, 3:07, 3:07, 3:08, 3:05.

the total average was 3:10.1 we take those

but run with the wind rly just inspired me on that

the best thing to call a long distance runner isnt fast, its strong. am i as fast as fitz, lowery, austin, cooper, logan or even sam and zalit and kaleb? no im not but i rly think i ran the strength out of the me today and thats what im proud of

lmao lyrics... the song is banger tho "Feed yourself with my life's work; How many likes is my life worth?"

idk im just tired asf today for no reason... just did close to nothing but im still hella tired...

woke up at again, 3:45 when i slept at midnight... i fell asleep at 12:00 flat (stats from my watch) and didn't feel good so decided to study some sat since sating on sat (another pun intended). went to practice at 6:10, almost late but we were ok in the end.

did went in just on time to practice in the end and actually felt decent after warmup, quad felt ok and legs feel ok.. so decided to go with austin kyminh and logan for some easy running. just to my principle i went 1.5 mile extra during it and ideally plan for a 5am lr tmr (10/11 miles sounds rly good atm).. got a 8.5 miler in at 8:10 pacing, hr looks very very healthy at 158 bpm avg... my heart seems like in peak condition rn and my speed work is lacking a lil bit, but thats salvable after my quad feels better ideally.. 

walked with devon after practice and was a lil enjoyable walk since i got nothing to be done anyways.. copied his hw on his car hood again... content is lacking again...

first period i did again, nothing... kinda just idled and did nothing... got like a bookwork prob in which is aok lol... first shot of espresso into the day and i had a full class migraine... surely ill get better after sat no...

second period was ap euro, got work done but kinda complained too much... i like the class but it is indeed a shit ton of work for no reason... warned by monahan during class after the worksheet... bickered with ainsley and managed to not fall asleep... second shot of espresso into the day and 33 mins of headache... monahan quote "i adore u in class but you gotta stop with the complaining somehow". adores the class but its a lot of just a lot of work.. its ok french prolly isnt better

third period apush was enjoyable ig... did project wrap ups and just chilled after. norbraten was subbing for the first half and somehow my hail mary attempt at the kitkat challenge was ok... fun fact new Mexico has the longest standing capital in usa with santa fe. kinda bickered with adeline but thats ok... was watching the 3h recording of the paris marathon for a bit (mile 1 to 5, mile 25 to finish) what a great race man... not a lot of head pain so were all good like 20 min ig

stats was uhhh awful... got clowned on by charlie again cuz i got a 88 on stats, so not in rhythm... its not even good for me... idk how i somehow pulled off a EPP or EEI wtf... ig i need to fucking fail in every single of my class to like not fail once... whats next physics and english??! ugh... head hurts cuz was rushing some ap classroom nonsense... 18/18 on set a and 13/18 on set b cuz i lost my ability to read.. its ok ill be fine on test surely.. 30 min of head pain for no good reason whatsoever

and then physics was aok i think? i liked that class... we went over tipers and i graded my atrocious 8/25 lmfao.. its fine i graded it properly trust... uhhh i assume i graded it properly and no correction is like best thing in this world lmfao i literally loopholed the tipers so its pog lmao.. 45 min of head hurting and its just torture.. fourth shot of espresso down and i was not feeling it. seems like charlie is gonna go with the map kids cuz of peer pressure kinda. me nathan dylan and evan is locked so yayy.

lunch was aok, didnt talk, just did some work and shots of espresso down... im tired asf by then

chem was like story story story bang bang bang.. took a group quiz but i rly dont wanna discuss cuz my head was about to burst.. so asked ms parker to work alone and she confirmed with me "the most idiotic decision ive seen in a long time" lmfao.. i ended up doing ok. either got 9/9 or 8/9 which is like pretty damn good, might have scored better than half of that class somehow??! and uhh i said to balin that "if yall score lower than me..." and parker just flipped out ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.. ya i think saying shit like that is uuhhhh lets say not proper... but its ok she was uhh not THAT mad... better than some other times that i pissed her off oops. but she was telling me this "i like you as a student (contrary to what you might believe) (lol ik its ok most of my teachers like me as a person but not a student) but you gotta chill out and like not talk smack too much, you can be so much more popular/making more friends that way" which is just true great statement by her

english was some project.. we realized that mr jay gatsby himself is ~~literally~~ metaphorically jesus... look at how he died and why he died and tell me im wrong!! had a lil discussion with brownfield about the ending of some steinbeck books. the of mice and men ending was like perf delivered, giving off "he aims his pistol at the sky" from ham kinda vibe, the east of eden ending was also not bad, grape of wrath was like mid at best.. i feel like there was def better ways to do the theme without roseasharon breastfeeding someones elses kid but what do i know about murican literature

saw kat emma kennedy and elizabeth while waiting for the bus (the dreaded group of kids lmfao) but its ok talked to them ok.. 

went home and kind all-ined on the sat prep, last day so lmfao.. got like 2 english modules done and i think im safe for 1500 tmr? aiming for 60 to 100 obv but we gotta do what we gotta do.. read over some grammar stuff for the last time and were heading down to bed

10:52 pm rn and im gonna try to run tmr on 6h sleep.. wish me luck and goodnight houston!

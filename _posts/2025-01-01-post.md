went into some more classical parts of music today (well recently ig since piano is taking a lot of time

canon on a guitar is one hell of a piece

brings hope in times of despair and brings calmness in times of craziness

its a vibe kinda reminds me of a someone i know

wont say the name but who reads it should know

its 2025

im sick and still coughing

still running with heartburn but what can i do

life sucks from time to time

but surely if a blind and deaf person can became a composer of the times

i can play my cards right

isnt life symphony of the times

let mine be vivaldis summer

i liked that a lot

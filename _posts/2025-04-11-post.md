i rly didnt do any cp after usaco open

but that prolly marks the end of usaco season unless i get very insanely lucky

667 was free and i decided to settle and play safe aka partial

well that prolly does it, good run

sr yr holstein run would be insanely hard and barely beneficial but why tf not eh

and then it was the long segment of lack of motivation

didnt wanna touch a keyboard, didnt wanna think

and then track season was over

never wanted to run less in my life

and tendonitis hit somehow lol

its recoving at a pretty slow pace oops

uil district was also just sad

barely hit t3 in region for math, 2 pts behind bowen which is most likely made up

and couldnt convert a win ns oops

its what it is

ap season starts, uil season starts, maybe just redeem oneself during that point

lol and then im gonna pull off all 4 and 4th at region oops

now time for some jasoncore ranting

i realized the care that one receives isnt necessarily related to the care that one gives out

sometime its just the polar opposite

people have all of their situations and circumstances and many fail to understand

rly just shows it when i spend the last two weeks home alone

the people i care or cared about mostly dont reciprocate and thats ok

its just hard to understand and expect people to be understanding all the time

issok i still have all the uil kiddos and the twins

when will i learn to just stop caring and learn to get good before anything

maybe i just get good and call it a day...

theres still 2 or 3 prep weeks, maybe getting good will have a change in scenary, since, everyone like those who are stronger, right?

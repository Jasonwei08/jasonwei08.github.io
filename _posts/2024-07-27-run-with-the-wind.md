man i read this book like 4 times already and every time i learned something more every time i read this.

some plot summary: a dorm room of college students, decided to challenge the most challenging cross country race in the country. some stats to notice is that they improved from the avg of 17 min 5k to close to 65 min on a 20k race. the book has a lot of small details that just tears me up so i recommend reading. there also seems to be an anime version of this. i personally dont like anime so i didnt watch it but the ppl online say its very good so ya.

will be adding some quotes i like in the book here

first varsity meet ever

unfort prolly the last for a long time

ran the open mile got 4th

started awful and weather was worse so that didnt end up working in my favor

lap 2 and 3 i took back 5-6 ppl but kyminh sam and jennings were all too ahead of me in the end

all 3 of them ended up around 4:59 and i ended up around 5:05

i called sub 5 wins it

sub 5 won it

i went out too easy thinking i got it in the end...

wtf was i thinking

the one chance i got to stay on varsity (well more than the thought/chances of) i threw it away

sigh smile be happy the vibes were what counts

idk got some work done after meet and went walking around

did another 4 miler to think and calm down

watched lowery ran 2nd and lost to merino and cooper logan grinding out of the best 32s ive watched

nolan and bo traded them lead all race long

faz alex aubrey raced great

i mean the vibes were what it was and ig i wont get them vibes again soon or ever

uh im going back to jv again

i failed again...

but ig smile or sigh or do wtv

get long run done and get it tgt for aime...

gcm visit for the 3rd time in a long while ig

laksh allen abel aayush riley might be a fun hangout for a bit before my test

3h test is hella scary

but isnt the vibes what it counts

i reread 1984 animal farm and supernova era for the 3rd time today

made me think

why did we read 451 in school instead of 1984

always thought 1984 was a more well rounded and deeper book

and then i realized 451 had a somewhat good ending and 1984 didnt

if you dont care about spoilers read ahead

451 had the revolution of a society leading to a reconstruction that bradbury hinted to be successful

1984 had the darkness collapse as a burden and the protagonist changing with no hints of change or anything whatsoever

451 gave hope

1984 didnt

i tried to expand the logic to to kill a mockingbird

maybe thats why we never read catcher in the rye

tkam gave some sort of hope catcher in the rye didnt

but why do they want to give us hope 

when were all stuck in a system without any hope

and i read the namiya general store again

that is one hell of a healing book

well lets all end it with harold fry

its not the walking that hurt, its the heart getting involved

nobody to run with this morning cuz mason ditched me and sam/jack were going too fast ðŸ˜­. i think the varsity issue needs to addresssed asap cuz [redacted] and [redacted] running with varsity is gonna piss all the fast freshmen off (ive heard 4 of them ranting about that today)

anyways, got a good 6.5 miler in today, i think a very decent mileage for the day and will hopefully get a bike ride in td and do some nice, speedy workout tmr

also i think pissed off [redacted] kinda bad today but i apologized and hopefully it goes better... ya talked too much lol

segtree suck btw, i cant type seg for anything for some reason....

espresso (the song) kinda bangs atm

truly a new mindset that i acquired...   now i realized theres way too many ppl who use me as a resource than a fucking person.. as ifrm said "maybe they just care about what you have rather than what you are"

its also funny i prolly get blame shifted by [redacted] and prolly inf other ppl lol. eh ig i have twins and hubers?

cant believe there can exist someone this fake i actually cant understand shit like this.. how are you like literally saying the most hurtful shit ive ever heard and smiling and talking to ethan and evan like that? i would and could never

bell rang for physics. ill walk with twins to lunch. i dont know what im gonna do when theyre gone but im scared... 12b tmr can someone help me pls

ill write more during lunch surely

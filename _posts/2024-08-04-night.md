cf was a mess, arc was a bigger mess.. woke up an hour late for arc... and A took me 45 min??! ya its so over from that point on... cf was speedforces but my dumbass cant solve F1.... will writeup both tmr.... also owing nfls writeups... im so behind... has 9 todos on the list... its wtv... will make up

did some book problems td was actually decent.. i feel like the most helpful stuff is coming from book problems now which is good... ya reading algo guide is useful fs... camp push is looking like a shape now...

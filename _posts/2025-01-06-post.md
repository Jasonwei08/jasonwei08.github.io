today is last day of winter break

today was not a good day

knee was hurting and it might be it band

pls dont do this 2 weeks out from marathon i cant

the nap was too long

contests werent good for my own sanity

why cant i solve trivial nt problems now...

so sad too bad

was not the most productive today

well for a fact i was not productive at all tbh?

listened to more concerts today

someone take me to some concerts pls i like the vibes so much

i hate sitting at home alone and doing nothing with my life

and yet im gonna complain about usaco

and i need to run more

tmr is school

i dont wanna go back to school

that means i have to deal with stupid kids again

and i dont wanna deal with stupid kids

contemplating whether i should stay in cafeteria tmr

idk theres more than 1 ppl i dont wanna see tmr at the cafeteria

also theres more than 1 ppl i dont wanna see tmr if i dont stay

well the tranquility that i always wanted is gone now

just try to focus on stuff ig

maybe everything redeems itself post camp?

this lyric stuck in my head

so are you gonna die today or make it out alive

fly, phoenix, fly

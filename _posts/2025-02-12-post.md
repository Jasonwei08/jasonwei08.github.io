walked laksh to his portable classroom (wtf is gcm going with this portable classroom shit

ate lunch in kangs room, he showed up midday cuz aime excused his day and it didnt excuse mine ðŸ˜­

anyways went into library and played cards with kang laksh and allen, realized that books with math games might be the call with the gifts

started test 1pm on the dot, lowkey loud in the lib so lowkey didnt focus

a certain someone (riley was upset with science team placements today ðŸ˜›, show up more often and grind physics ig

this certain person also realized team placement wasnt fair cuz of attendance and went rant before leaving for softball

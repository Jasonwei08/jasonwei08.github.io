today i woke up and ran

heartburn cease to exist and 14 days till the final race

maybe now is the perfect time to peak

cf was awful?

cf was awful

cant figure out a segtree for the life of me and now i barely get positive delta

took a nap

realized that mason sent me reels

henry sent me reels

emma carper sent me capybara reels per her usual

the run with alex was actually somewhat enjoyable

i honestly didn't expect a lot out of that guy but it was fun while it lasted

upsolves

another run

yap about nothing and everything

talked to aliz for a brief moment

agreed upon that school system sucks

more thinking to do

the ideology with women in stem (another brief discussion with charlie

surely its solvable but measures are quite hard to achieve uniformity

plus with assholes like me around its hard to enforce

la Lumiere finale is french for the final light

its the final darkness for me? or the final light

last 2 weeks of darkness before my training sees daylight at Houston

last 3 weeks of light on training before i go blind into usaco

talked to haccerkat about apps

i might be gigascrewed

gpa sucks ec sucks

i dont camp its joever

am i ready

no

but do i care now

prolly not

uh thanks to aliz and emma carper to keep my day somewhat not too boring

thanks to walrus twins and like the entire karp server to help me with cf

thanks to haccerkat to help me with apps

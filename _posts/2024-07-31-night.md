295 thing is kinda sorted out here gonna record some thoughts..

i do think Danny is gonna have his own plans on the continuence of 295 while rpeng is gonna have icpc team selection perms.. well thats what it seems like atm. im unfortunately caught up in the middle of this... i think the idea is bkpt do the main prob selecting here and i can farm some other probs and hopefully hours??! thats the idea for now ig

no big nfls contest td but some sort of SCC dp contest.. did like 6/12 probs, will do more tmr morning after nap ig? but at least i got postcontest from yesterdays contest done which is infintely good. 

also just realized that its time to cut off some socials here and there... its last 8 months you gotta do what u gotta do prolly making a list of what i can talk to:

- rpeng, Danny, bkpt (reply asap, can start convos on CP if bored)

- Boris/Kevin/Yann/ucup team (reply asap but no putting off other things, can start a bit of convos on CP)

- Joseph/Vincent/Aliz (reply, try not to start convos)

- cs club to monkey with code (reply if needed, no starting convos unless cp-related)

- school ppl (reply if want to, no starting convos in any way)

all the non-talking is gonna come on the blog so if im not talking to ya im sorry but this is where im gonna talk what id talk to u about

do more nfls shit and dont just do nonsense again...

also gonna stop on hearth/phigros cuz gonna go all in for cow camp

read ALGO GUIDE WHEN U HAVE TIME CANT FUCKING FAIL AGAIN THIS YR

if anyone see me not doing my shit pls tell me and tell me to go back to work

again last 8 months if you make it u make it if you dont its ggwp

i mean my relationships with kids at school is close to a freeze point anyways (esp with twins, kennedy, mckinley and the hubers) might as well not make my ass feel miserable and just do what i gotta do

tmr is trials idec anymore as if bush will put me on varsity if i run fast his dumbass is gonna put [redacted] there again might as well kill me

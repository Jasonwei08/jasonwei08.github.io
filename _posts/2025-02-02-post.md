through the rough we reach the stars

nothing fun went on since last blog

i talked some past issues out with someone (hopefully at least) so thats sweet

had one hell of an emotional rollercoaster friday night

i mean i was scared like a dog the two days prior knee was hurting workout was mid and legs were tired

didnt expect myself to be in the fastest heat and rly wanted to switch heats with some other ppl that were most likely faster than me

friday was scary and did 2 mile shakeout realized my legs were toast

k park is hella nice btw omg their trails are actually rly pretty i wanna go there more often

but i did strike gold with that long warmup 2.5 to 3 is prolly my sweet point

i shit you not i was crying on the line cuz i was scared that im gonna go dead fucking last

somehow that ended in one of the best scenarios

went out at 72 for lap 1, 75 for lap 2, 77 for lap 3

realized it was 3:45 on the dot by the time i cross 1200 and i went for it

last 200 of the back stretch was prolly the hardest part but i love logan he was there with me

"stay with me now jason stay with me"

as he said, dying out of breath

unfort both him and nolan has better finishes than me so i ended up last among them 3

beat out garrett and matt (but im so sad for him) and some kp kid for 4th to last, we take those

first sub 5 mile clocking at 4:56 i think

long run was fucked regardless legs were too dead sob

attempting crazy stuff at school ping me if you wanna know and ill see if i can tell you or not :sob:

im jv with sub 5 this is truly a moment of the times

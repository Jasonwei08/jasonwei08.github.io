i think ive seen this film before so im leaving out the side door

wow its been a week since i last wrote

well woodlands marathon finished

and i finished

first 20 miles were actually pretty ok, dropped a lil bit of speed at mile 17 but we ball

the thing about woodlands, the elevation is close to 1.2k instead of 300 stated on map

cramped tf up at miel 21, stopped at aid station for 30 min, walked till end, finished 447 or sth

disappointed, needed to hit the gym and build my legs a lil bit more

esp my quads, need to add some hill training into the plan

rest of the week is just meh, nothing good and a lil bit of bad stuff, school wasnt good and had some little fuckups on my tests

but we deal with it

not a lot of life updates, realized my notif outside of discord converges to 0, the people who talks to me on discord converges to 9, thanks to the 9 ppl who do talk to me

i have worked on myself to where i dont get fomo as often as used to now

many fun dinners, gifts, xc funsies happened without me, and i know it

but at least when im not there i dont care about it enough

maybe my expectations are too high and i just dont deserve a gift on my bday

sigh ill talk to someone about that later ig

funny how i care about how the ppl cares about me on my bday than the bday itself

but dont we all

i saw garrett on the run today he died out on west ranch needed a ride home

i called chase

chase came 10 mins later

austin asked garrett to run the workout with them tmr

i ask he says no

fomo hits hard

i ran home and i cry

running serves as therapy now and i enjoy running more than ever

putting my heart into the place where it hurts the most and let it stay there

isnt that life story

and id rather put my heart in pain than someone put it in pain

home meet in like 4 days

surely i get to deliver this time

lowkey wanna run the 4 by 4 again

such a fun race for me

so i email bush and see what he says

idk why i put exile on repeat on the run today

holding all this love out here in this hall

i think ive seen this film before

and i didnt like the ending

i think the film plays out

and i wont like the ending

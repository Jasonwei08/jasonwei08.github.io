rather peaceful day ngl. not a lot of interactions going on td... the run yap nap book angle was goated ðŸ˜›. book was helpful td which is nice....

cant believe im reviewing motonic queue/stack and almost lost on impling it but lol its ok... or is it... i mean i got them down... but prolly should speed the process up a wee bit since time is of the essence.

practice was surprisingly fun tho... 6:30 is infinitely better than 7. had first good, controlled run in a hot minute. but like it has been the singular hardest time its been for me to crack a boiled egg. its your fault charlie....

emailed bush about not running races this yr... decisions decisions... i mean the half day saturday def has some better uses than just running alone right.. plus rpeng did say like dont run for the social interaction. run to run... which you prolly should do better on honestly... yapping too much doing too little.

bush told me to talk to him tmr... idek what im supposed to do... lol i have to make the choice here dont i... unfortunate...

a lot of book readings td and will make up more after this....

10:13pm rn but i will write more

goodnight houston
